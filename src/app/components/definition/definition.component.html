    Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client
    applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It
    implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries
    that you import into your apps. The architecture of an Angular application
    relies on certain fundamental concepts. The basic building blocks of the
    Angular framework are Angular components that are organized into NgModules.
    NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is
    defined by a set of NgModules. An app always has at least a root module that
    enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.
